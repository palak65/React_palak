*Internet of Things (IoT):

1.How do IoT devices communicate and share data with each other?
-> IoT is the connection of devices over the internet, where these smart devices communicate with 
   each other , exchange data ,perform some tasks without any human involvement.
-> IoT devices share this data through an IoT gateway or platform or another IoT device.
   Data is typically sent to the cloud for storage and analysis.

2.How is IoT technology being used to create smart cities and improve urban
  living?

-> A smart city uses Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in urban areas to collect data and 
   automate systems such as traffic, energy use, and waste management. By doing so, smart cities 
   the efficiency of urban services, reduce costs, and deliver a higher standard of living.

*Artificial Intelligence (AI):

1. How is AI transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and
   transportation?
-> AI transforms the finance industry by improving risk management, fraud detection, and 
   investment strategies. AI algorithms can analyze financial data to identify patterns and 
   make predictions, helping businesses and individuals make informed decisions.

*Cybersecurity:

1.How does encryption work to protect data?
-> Encryption is used to protect data from being stolen, changed, or compromised and works 
   by scrambling data into a secret code that can only be unlocked with a unique digital key.

2.What are the challenges in securing the Internet of Things (IoT) devices?
->
-Botnets
-Ransomware
-IoT security awareness
-shadow iot
-weak passwords
-Insecure interfaces
-limited device management
-insecure communications
-insecure data transfer and storage
-Lack of secure update mechanism
-physical safety risks
-data privacy
-Insufficient privacy protection
-Security threats
-weak Authenticaton
-Use of insecure or outdated components
-5G vulnerabilities
-Advanced persistent threats
-Data leaks from IoT systems
-DNS threats
-Espionage and eavesdropping
-IoT physical security
-IoT security awareness
-Lack of compliance

*Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:

1.How does blockchain technology ensure the security and integrity of
  transactions?
->It uses cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services and best practices to reduce risks 
  against attacks and fraud. Blockchain technology produces a structure of data with inherent 
  security qualities. It's based on principles of cryptography, decentralization and consensus, 
  which ensure trust in transactions.

2.How do cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum differ from traditional
  currencies?
->Cryptocurrencies have no legislated or intrinsic value; 
  they are simply worth what people are willing to pay for them in the market. 
  This is in contrast to national currencies, which get part of their value from 
  being legislated as legal tender.

*Big Data and Analytics:

1.What are the privacy concerns associated with big data collection and
  usage?
-> Big data poses various concerns, notably privacy, and data exploitation. 
   Big data privacy concerns refer to the threats and risks associated with collecting, storing, 
   analyzing, and using vast amounts of personal information in the era of data-driven decision-making.

*Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

1.How do VR and AR technologies create immersive experiences?
->Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two principal types of immersive technologies. 
  These technologies share many of the same qualities. AR blends computer-generated information onto 
  the user's real environment, while VR uses computer-generated information to provide a full sense of 
  immersion.

2.What are the applications of VR and AR in fields like education,
  entertainment, and healthcare?
->Beyond gaming, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have a significant impact on 
  education through immersive learning, support industrial training needs, facilitate manufacturing 
  prototyping, enhance retail with virtual try-ons, aid in healthcare training, and 
  transform real estate tours



*5G Technology:
1.How does 5G technology different from previous generations of mobile networks?
->5G can be significantly faster than 4G, delivering up to 20 Gigabits-per-second (Gbps) peak 
  data rates and 100+ Megabits-per-second (Mbps) average data rates. 5G has more capacity than 4G. 
  5G is designed to support a 100x increase in traffic capacity and network efficiency. 
  5G has lower latency than 4G.

* Robotics:
1.How are robots being used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare,
  and agriculture?
->Robots are widely used in automotive assembly lines for welding, painting, pick-and-place tasks, and 
  quality control. Healthcare: Robots aid surgeons in surgeries, ensuring faster recovery. 
  Robotic exoskeletons assist rehabilitation and help patients regain mobility post-injury.
